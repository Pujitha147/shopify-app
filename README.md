# Xeno-Shopify

üöß Known Limitations / Assumptions

Only basic fields from Shopify entities are stored. (Extendable for more fields.)

Assumes a single Shopify store per deployment.

No pagination handling yet for very large datasets.

Authentication is JWT-based, but role-based access control is not implemented.

DB migrations must be handled manually before production.
